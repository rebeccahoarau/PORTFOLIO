# PORTFOLIO
I AM BY NO MEANS A CODER. I HAVE NEVER CLAIMED TO BE A CODER. EXCEPT FOR MAYBE THAT ONE TIME I WAS AT A DINNER PARTY AND MET A FRIEND'S PARTNER FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND DESPERATE TO MAKE A CHARMING FIRST IMPRESSION, I MAY HAVE OVER EXAGGERATED MY PASSION FOR WEB DEVELOPMENT. MOSTLY, IT WAS TRUTH, BUT NOTHING OF MY FERVEROUS RANTS ON OLD-WEB-OBSESSION MAKE THEIR WAY INTO A CODING SOFTWARE. HERE I AM, TOM. I'M DOING THE THING. HOPE YOU AND GEMMA ARE WELL.
